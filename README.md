We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.
Getting started documentation can be found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/).

```sh
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/zykdtc/animator.git
cd animator
# Set up local environment with all optional and dev dependencies
# Creates a virtual environment called `.venv`
uv sync
# Test with sample
uv run tests/sample/sample.py
```
